# Biography

My name is Shangtong Zhang (张尚彤). Now I am a research intern at the Huaiwei Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving Lab (Edmonton). I will start my DPhill at University of Oxford from October 2018 with Prof. [Shimon Whiteson](http://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/). Thanks for the generous funding from [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/) and Dept. of Computer Science, University of Oxford. 

I graduated from Dept. of Computing Science, University of Alberta in July 2018 with a master's degree specialized in statistical machine learning. I worked with Prof. [Richard S. Sutton](http://incompleteideas.net/). Thesis committees: Prof. [Patrick M. Pilarski](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~pilarski/) and Prof. [Dale Schuurmans](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~dale/).

Before coming to Edmonton, I graduated from School of Computer Science, Fudan University in June 2016 with a bachelor's degree. I worked with Prof. [Xiaoqing Zheng](http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/zhengxq/) and Prof. [Wenqiang Zhang](http://www.cs.fudan.edu.cn/?page_id=2022).
